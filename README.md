## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development Commands

Install new UI library components from [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs):

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>
```

Run these 2 commands every time schema.prisma is modified.

Generate schema to add it to the node modules to develop with it:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Create the collections in database:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

To re-migrate and reset all of database data:

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
```

After re-migrate you need to run `generate` and `push` again.

Manipulate data in all of Prisma projects with [`Prisma Studio`](https://www.prisma.io/studio):

```bash
npx prisma studio
```
